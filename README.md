# pyChat
Proof of Concept that demonstrates the use of a Firebase Realtime database in a chat application. 

## Installation 
First you need to install the Firebase Python SDK :  
```pip install firebase-admin```    
Then you have to install Kivy, we **recommend** doing that in a **virtual environnement** : 
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools    
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew  
python -m pip install kivy.deps.gstreamer  
python -m pip install kivy.deps.angle  
python -m pip install kivy   
 ```
You also need a file named service-key.json which you can export from your Firebase Realtime database.
